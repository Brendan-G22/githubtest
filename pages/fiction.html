        <h2>Six of Crows (Leigh Bardugo)</h2>
        <h3>$6.64</h3>
        <p>Ketterdam: a bustling hub of international trade where anything can be had for the right price—and no one 
        knows that better than criminal prodigy Kaz Brekker. Kaz is offered a chance at a deadly heist that could make 
        him rich beyond his wildest dreams. But he can't pull it off alone. . . .</p>

        <p>A convict with a thirst for revenge.</p>

        <p>A sharpshooter who can't walk away from a wager.</p>

<p>A runaway with a privileged past.</p>

<p>A spy known as the Wraith.</p>

<p>A Heartrender using her magic to survive the slums.</p>

<p>A thief with a gift for unlikely escapes.</p>

<p>Six dangerous outcasts. One impossible heist. Kaz's crew is the only thing that might stand between the 
world and destruction—if they don't kill each other first.</p>

<p>Six of Crows by Leigh Bardugo returns to the breathtaking world of the Grishaverse in this unforgettable 
tale about the opportunity—and the adventure—of a lifetime</p>

          <h4>The most Fun Thing(Kyle Beachy)</h4>
          <h5>$12.39</h5>
          <p>For years, rumors of the “Marsh Girl” have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. 
          So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called 
          Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh 
          that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to 
          be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new 
          life—until the unthinkable happens.</p>

<p>Where the Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a 
surprising tale of possible murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were, and 
that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.</p>

         <h3>To Kill a Mockingbird (Harper Lee)</h3>
         <h4>$24.99</h4>
         <p>One of the most cherished stories of all time, To Kill a Mockingbird has been translated into more than forty 
         languages, sold more than forty million copies worldwide, served as the basis for an enormously popular motion 
         picture, and was voted one of the best novels of the twentieth century by librarians across the country. A gripping,
         heart-wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by virulent prejudice, it views a 
         world of great beauty and savage inequities through the eyes of a young girl, as her father—a crusading local 
         lawyer—risks everything to defend a black man unjustly accused of a terrible crime.</p>
